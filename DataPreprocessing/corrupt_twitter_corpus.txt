I need more info on ^^ people's ^^ definition of the word "rigged." Do you ^^ mean literal vote-tampering, or a system of self-perpetuating power?
Like are you saying there's an actual conspiracy <i> here, or are you just it takes money and power to <b> get % political influence?
And if the latter, % % is this idea new to $ you?
When Trump <i> says "the election is @ rigged" to the media, he means </span> "it's a biased system favoring entrenched politico".
I'm also curious <b> how @ this compares $ with Sanders supporters' complaints of a rigged economic system &amp; primary.
To those complaints, my response alternates between "no it's @ not" and "of course it is. You're </span> just figuring that </b> out?"
As </b> a career public servant, it is often troubling to see experience and dedication to % the public cause @ turned against someone.
I'm far more disturbed by the role of @ @ <b> money in politics than the role of "insider influence."
You % can relax <b> about the influence of money in politics - % it has only been an issue since the Roman Republic (509-27BC).
Longstanding $ <b> problems </span> can still be disturbing problems.

If you think about it, what's absent from <b> the Wikileaks $ emails is at least as intriguing % as what's in them.
Please ^^ </b> go on, <i> Ron.
Well, there's little or no substantive ^^ discussion $ of her health - neither confirming the spin </b> of her camp or otherwise.
There's also very little about ^^ Bill Clinton, % from what ^^ I've seen.
Given the seeming candor <b> if not recklessness of the stuff we have seen, there's a remarkable absence of emails about <i> policy %
It's almost as if this <i> is a <b> head fake - a calculated release of embarrassing <b> but unfortunately not really damning or &gt;
or criminal material and a studied absence of ^^ discussion @ about key issues, people and problems - complete with a media @ &gt;
and $ "expert" buy-in of % this "Russian hack" cover story to assure "authenticity" and imply completeness - yet virtually no &gt; </b>
attempt to explain or deny the emails' authenticity. Remarkably little. Since when is <b> the ^^ DNC shy about </b> lying?
It's as if these were $ released to @ give the impression that we really have the whole story now and it's </b> not that awful.
Again, that </b> observation arises from the gaps in subject matter, the lack % $ of denials and the evident ease of the "hacks."

</b> Really not sure what to expect from Miami Heat $ ^^ this season
hopefully the ^^ 7th or 8th seed </b> in the </span> East
I could $ see 6th or maybe <i> even 5th if everyone plays up to $ par and to the potential and it all starts with Whiteside
idk </span> Eastern confrence has gotten % % way better, idk what to make of the Heat's roster
it's a thinker of a </b> <b> situation but Heat's roster is a ok one <i> I'd say so ehhh idk
Whiteside, Haslem, </b> Dragic, Winslow, Richardson, % and Waitors are solid but idk what to @ make of the rest of the team
if those specific players can stay healthy and not be dumb and get suspensions % or anything then Miami </span> </b> could be decent I'd say
% like I said hopefully </b> 7th or 8th </b> seed. knowing Pat Riley he is already planing for free agency 2017
nobody ever knows what Riley gonna do, how he @ <i> gonna shock us like he ^^ be doing but I agree with a 6,7 seed
the key to the season is seeing how Whiteside handles being the star $ </b> and how Winslow &amp; Richardson <i> develop in their second year
exactly % and we all know how Whiteside's emotions can get the better of him oh man &amp; also <i> I'm very $ hopefully of Richardson
and hopefuly <i> Chris Bosh </b> can come back and play at some point this $ season. also I forgot about Tyler Johnson he can ball too
Tyler Johnson yes he good lowkey and it's an unknown situation % for </span> Bosh, hopefully $ he can but I don't want him to risk it

$ @ we have an outside chance but @ it's tough. A lot depends on how seriously Conte is taking the competition.Least we're improving

good point. Hopefully! <b> I'd ^^ love a cup run but honestly be pleased enough with a <i> good performance and close game

odds on Dimi to score <i> a direct FK or solo run? Or another Lanzini $ v % Chelsea banger 😉

fun <i> <i> w/numbers ^^ on six flags Q3 press release: a tweetstorm
six flags income dropped 24% in Q3 b/c of compensation to executives % for their </b> likely success of "project 600" ($600m in adj <b> EBITDA by '17)
</b> in order to achieve this goal, SF would ^^ need <i> to grow EBITDA by just under 14% from '15-17. this would be considered "aggressive"
% problems: guest spending is trending down over the $ year, with per cap spend 1% lower $ in Q3 than Q3 2015 and up for year by less than 1%
Q3 <b> revenue was also down in peak months $ by ^^ 3% and EBITDA was down roughly the same amount. earnings per share down 34%
$ six flags will indicate that expansion of holiday event should bring in new <i> revenue, but trend of per cap spending % drops shouldnt be ignored
very real possibility that their <i> <b> business plan is beginning to hit a wall. expanding season passholder ^^ base has natural limits.
also addition of </span> events has potential dilution <b> effect wherein lieu of expanding attendance numbers, same amount just % disperse over calendar
this means that % while you still % have to staff the parks for peak periods in summer, there are fewer guests <i> generally arriving on off days
instead, they just show $ up later in the @ $ year.
tl;dr version: six flags growth is slowing/mb </span> dunzo ^^ and may miss their projections but execs paid <i> themselves like they would hit it anyways
enough, <i> $ <i> what about skittles
still not as good as M&amp;Ms but both </b> contain blue 1 which can cross @ the blood brain % barrier and may cause neurocognitive probs
