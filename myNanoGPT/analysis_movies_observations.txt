Summary of movie dataset cleaning, preparation, and sampling

Files added/updated:
- scripts/clean_input.py  — new cleaning script (backs up raw input and writes cleaned input)
- data/movies/input_clean.txt  — cleaned version of the movie corpus
- prepare_movies.log  — output from running `data/movies/prepare.py` on the cleaned input
- samples_movies.txt  — 5 sample outputs generated from the checkpoint (if present)

Key actions performed:
- Backed up original raw corpus to `data/movies/input_raw.txt`.
- Cleaned corpus to strip HTML-like tags, unescape entities, remove control chars, and collapse whitespace.
- Re-ran `prepare.py` on cleaned input.
  - New token counts: train = 4,380,134 tokens; val = 486,435 tokens
  - (Previous tokenization on the raw input was: train = 5,909,906; val = 655,952)
- Restarted training in background with conservative params (eval_interval=50, max_iters=500) so checkpoints occur quickly for inspection.

Artifacts and notes:
- Checkpoint present (if saved): `myNanoGPT/out_movies/ckpt.pt` (~87 MB)
- Samples written to: `myNanoGPT/samples_movies.txt` — early samples show noisy tokens but cleaning should improve coherence as training continues.

Recommendations / next steps:
1. Continue background training for more iterations (increase `--max_iters`) to improve sample quality.
2. Consider further corpus cleanup (remove rare tokens or explicit HTML snippets) or normalize punctuation.
3. If you want to preserve large checkpoint files in the repo, use Git LFS or an external artifact storage; do not add 80+ MB checkpoints to git on the main branch.

Contact: I can push these files now (except large binary checkpoint) or create a branch if you prefer.
